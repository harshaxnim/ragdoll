_______
Summary
```````
"doll.cc" is a physics engine especially made for ragdoll. However, we do get reasonable results for cloth simulation as well.

____
Make
````
To make, type make in the terminal. The make will check for the OS (macOS or Linux) and make accordingly.

____________
Dependencies
````````````
OpenGL– Graphics Library
	SOIL– Image Loading Library
	GLUT– Windowing Library

Requires all the libraries as shared (in the respective directories)

_______
Execute
```````
To execute, type ./runThis after making the executable (see make)

Caveats and Deviations from the paper
`````````````````````````````````````
1. Not a 3D simulation, but not very difficult to change if required.
2. The paper talks about integrating a collision detection system, which is not done in the implementaion. There's a rudimentary implementaion of collision detection and handling by having/satisfying constraints.
3. Simple skeleton for the ragdoll.
